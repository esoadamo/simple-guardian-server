_"Every day, your VPS is under heavy fire from automated cracking software. 
All that it takes is only one weak password and your system can be compromised,
so maybe you want to block those attacks somehow.
But how do you do it? You may search the web and find that fail2ban is very useful in this case.
That's true, but maybe you are short on time or experience and so you may want something easier.
That's where simple guardian comes in. If you would begin right now, you could have your VPS protected under one minute.
How is that possible? Well, the simple guardian was created to be such an easy alternative to complicated software. Also, it supports managing multiple devices from one place in your web browser.
