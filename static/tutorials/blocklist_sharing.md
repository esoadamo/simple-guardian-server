_"Maybe you have already asked yourself something like "Why do I have to wait until the IP address that has already attacked on my device and was blocked will attack again? On one of my devices where it is not blocked yet?" I am proud to announce, that you **don't** have to wait! You can go to you settings and tick the **Blocklist sharing** box. When the box is ticked, all addresses that were blocked on one of your devices will be mirrored to all of them._

Side note: This feature was implemented in the version 2.0 of the Simple Guardian and as such is not covered in the legacy web GUI at all._"_ - Adam

### TL;DR

You can set your devices to share their blocked IP addresses between them. To enable this feature, head to your account's configuration and tick the **Blocklist sharing** box.
